# API Testing in Android

As the name suggests, this project allows to us to implement simple REST API calling in android using Android Studio. 

Even though the app uses a specific API, this code can be assumed to be generic and hence be used for a wide variety of APIs. 

The app uses the OkHttp library for sending and receiving requests.

The project uses the Cat Facts API (https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/) that provides us with random facts about cats and dogs. A text view was created to facilitate the containment of the 
fact which was of type string. 

A button view was created to initiate the process of request sending.
